This snippet is based on a 3-hour 4-task Software Developer test as defined in /doc/SoftwareDevTest.txt. 

The task is to write a program that reads a CSV file with information about different regular polygons (all sides equal), and circles. Each row of the file contains the name of the polygon and its side length, in order.
Acceptable polygons include:

- triangle
- square
- pentagon

Note also that the shape "circle" should be accepted. Of course, a circle has no side length; instead, the dimension refers to its radius.

Here is an example CSV file:

triangle,3.5
circle,2

Given the input above, your program should output:

A triangle with side length 3.5 u has a perimeter of 10.5 u and an area of 5.30 u^2
A circle with radius 2 u has a perimeter of 12.57 u and an area of 12.57 u^2

Please write your solution using classes and objects as appropriate.

Next, provide a judicious amount of unit tests for all the above requirements. You do not need to use a
third-party unit testing tool. Just write some tests that give your code a good run for its money.
